-- A. Customer Nodes Exploration

-- How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
-- What is the number of nodes per region?
-- How many customers are allocated to each region?
-- How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
-- What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
